# Prometheus & Grafana Setup (High-Level)

1. **Prometheus** Configuration
   - Create a `prometheus.yml` configuration file specifying scrape jobs for:
     - Kafka brokers (`:9092/metrics` or JMX exporter)
     - Spark (via JMX, or a spark-prometheus sink)
     - Airflow (via a StatsD exporter or custom plugin)

2. **Grafana** Configuration
   - Run Grafana, for example:
     ```bash
     docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --name grafana grafana/grafana
     ```
   - Configure Prometheus as a data source in Grafana.
   - Import or create dashboards for:
     - Kafka broker metrics (messages in/out, consumer lag)
     - Spark batch/streaming jobs (throughput, error counts)
     - Airflow DAG and task metrics

3. **Add to Docker Compose (Optional)**
   - Additional containers for Prometheus and Grafana can be added to `docker-compose.yaml`.
   - Example snippet:
     ```yaml
     prometheus:
       image: prom/prometheus
       ports:
         - "9090:9090"
       volumes:
         - ./prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml

     grafana:
       image: grafana/grafana
       ports:
         - "3000:3000"
     ```
4. **Alerts**
   - Configure alerting rules in Prometheus `rules.yml`.
   - Run `alertmanager` and connect it to Slack, email, or other notification endpoints.
    - Example snippet:
      ```yaml
      alertmanager:
         image: prom/alertmanager
         ports:
            - "9093:9093"
         volumes:
            - ./alertmanager.yml:/etc/alertmanager/alertmanager.yml
      ```
      
5. **Monitoring**
    - Monitor the Prometheus and Grafana dashboards for Kafka, Spark, and Airflow metrics.
    - Set up alerts for critical metrics, such as consumer lag, Spark job failures, or Airflow task failures.

6. **Scaling**
    - As the system scales, adjust Prometheus and Grafana configurations to handle the increased load.
    - Consider sharding Prometheus, adding more Grafana instances, or using a dedicated monitoring solution like Datadog or New Relic.

7. **Maintenance**
    - Regularly update Prometheus, Grafana, and other monitoring components to the latest versions.
    - Monitor the monitoring system itself for performance issues or outages.
    - Review and update alerting rules and dashboards as the system evolves.

8. **Troubleshooting**
    - If metrics are missing or incorrect, check the Prometheus configuration and targets.
    - If Grafana dashboards are not updating, verify the data source connection and query settings.
    - For alerting issues, check the alertmanager configuration and notification endpoints.

9. **Security**
    - Secure Prometheus and Grafana with proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.
    - Encrypt communication between components using TLS/SSL certificates.
    - Regularly audit access logs and configurations for security vulnerabilities.

10. **Best Practices**
    - Use labels and annotations in Prometheus to organize and query metrics effectively.
    - Leverage Grafana templating to create dynamic dashboards for different environments or services.
    - Monitor the monitoring system itself to ensure it is reliable and up-to-date.
